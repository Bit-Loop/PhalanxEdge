# PhalanxEdge Core - ProxMesh Manager

# CURRENTLY A MANJOR WIP

**PhalanxEdge Core - ProxMesh Manager** is---ehensive automation suite designed for edge computing infrastructure with Proxmox virtualization environments and secure remote access via Tailscale mesh networking. It provides robust tooling for Proxmox infrastructure deployment, management, monitoring, and integration with mesh networking for distributed edge computing scenarios.

---

## What is PhalanxEdge Core?

PhalanxEdge Core is an advanced Ansible-based framework for managing edge computing infrastructure. The ProxMesh Manager component bridges Proxmox virtualization with Tailscale mesh networks to create a unified, secure edge computing platform. It enables secure authentication, dynamic inventory management, VM discovery, SMART monitoring, and comprehensive automation for Proxmox clusters. The framework automates key administrative tasks while providing audit trails and secure credential management through Ansible Vault.
